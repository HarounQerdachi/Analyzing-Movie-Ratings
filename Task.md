# Project Title: Analyzing Movie Ratings

## Project Description:

In this project, you will analyze movie ratings data to gain insights into the preferences of moviegoers. You'll use Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to load, clean, and visualize the data.

## Steps to Follow:

### Data Collection: 

Start by obtaining a dataset containing movie ratings. You can find movie rating datasets on websites like Kaggle or IMDb.

### Data Cleaning: 

Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types as needed.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Calculate basic statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation of movie ratings.
- Create histograms and box plots to visualize the distribution of ratings.
- Explore relationships between variables (e.g., rating vs. genre, rating vs. release year).

### Data Visualization:

Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create visualizations like bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to better understand the data.

### Top-Rated Movies:

Identify the top-rated movies based on user ratings and create a list or visualization of them.

### Genre Analysis:

Analyze which movie genres are the most popular and have the highest ratings.

### Time Trends:

Explore how movie ratings have changed over time by plotting ratings against release years.

### Conclusion and Insights: 

Summarize your findings. What insights can you draw from the data? Were there any surprising trends or patterns?

### Tools and Libraries:

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (for an interactive coding environment)
